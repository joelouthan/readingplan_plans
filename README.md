# Personal Plans for the ReadingPlan App

I love books. Ergo, I love reading plans. More so, I love reading the Bible.

In 2019, I took on the challenge of reading the Bible every thirty days. But then I started to try to read the Bible in a week or in an extended weekend. Once, I read it in a normal three-day weekend.

However, there are a serious lack of available reading plans to help me stay on track.

Fortunately, I ran in this amazing app call ReadingPlan.

It is not limited to the developer on what plans that are available. You can make up your own! More so than that, you can do it for any book. Check out my reading plan for [The Wonderful Works of God](bavinck-the_wonderful_works_of_God.ini) by Herman Bavinck.
