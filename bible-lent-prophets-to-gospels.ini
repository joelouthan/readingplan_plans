title=Lent - From the Prophets to the Gospels

[description]
Sometime ago, I dedicated myself to read the Bible every 30 days. What struck me to the core is how the Prophets used Scriptures to point out the sins of the people and the world and thus, laid out the consequences of their sins and the judgments of the God Almighty. Yet, that was never the final answer of God. I believe the Apostle Paul succinctly sums up the cries of the Prophets from Isaiah to the last lines of Malachi with this one question in Romans 7:24, "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?"  Turn the page and hear the words of the gospel writer, Matthew, "The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." Yes, that is right, Christ Jesus is his name!

The reading is paced for about 8 chapters a day. That is until you get closer to the Gospel John, then it slows down. Then into Holy Week, you will read the Passion of the Christ as it syncs up every day as to allow contemplative meditation, thoughts and prayers as Christ joyfully goes to the cross to "save His people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21) a. Lastly, you will read John 20 on Easter Sunday and I saved the calling of the Apostles in John 21 for the Easter Monday.
